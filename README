virt-who is agent for reporting virtual guest IDs to subscription manager
(SAM or Satellite).

It works either locally or via remote hypervisor. It obtains list of UUIDs
on specified hypervisor (or local system) and then it sends the list of UUIDs
(or host/guest association) to the subscription manager (SAM, Satellite).


Installation
------------
To just install it use:

# make DESTDIR=/usr install

You can also create rpm package with:

$ make rpm

and then install the package



Configuration
-------------

SAM:
    It uses rhsm configuration (usually in /etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf). The system
    needs to be registered in subscription-manager server before running
    the agent.

    It will behave in the same manner as SAM.

Satellite5:
    Configuration is stored in virt-who configuration file:
