# Make pytest load custom plugins expected to be loaded in our test suite.
#TODO: pytest (tested up to version 2.5.1) will not display our plugin marker
# information in its --markers list if called from a folder other than the one
# containing the tests folder or if the tests folder is not on the current
# Python path, e.g. if using pytest in the Python 3 implementation 'build'
# folder constructed by 'setup.py build' using 'py.test build --markers'. The
# plugin will still get loaded correctly when actually running the tests. This
# has already been reported as a pytest issue.
