"""
Assertion test utility functions shared between multiple test modules.

Extracted into a separate module, named so pytest would apply its assertion
rewriting to it.

'pytest' assertion rewriting allows our assertion test utility functions to use
Python assertions and have them work even when run with Python assertions
disabled.
