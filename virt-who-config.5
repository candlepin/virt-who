.TH VIRT-WHO-CONFIG "5" "October 2015" "virt-who"
.SH NAME
virt-who-config - configuration for virt-who
.SH SYNOPISIS
/etc/sysconfig/virt-who
/etc/virt-who.conf
/etc/virt-who.d/*.conf
.SH DESCRIPTION
Configuration format is ini-like for files /etc/virt-who.conf and /etc/virt-who.d/*.conf.
The contents of /etc/sysconfig/virt-who are environment variables to be used when virt-who is run as a service.
The configuration files located at /etc/virt-who.d/*.conf are called virtualization backend configurations.
All non-hidden files in this directory (ending in '.conf') are considered configuration files. If no section (name in square brackets) is present in the configuration file, it will be ignored and warning will be shown.
The configuration located at /etc/virt-who.conf is the main configuration for virt-who.
Below are descriptions of both the required and optional options for both kinds of configs and how they are used.
.SH GENERAL CONFIGURATION
The general configuration file (located at /etc/virt-who.conf), has three special sections \fBglobal\fR, \fBdefaults\fR, and \fBsystem_environment\fR.
The settings that can be specified in \fBdefaults\fR are any setting listed in the \fBVIRTUALIZATION BACKEND CONFIGURATION\fR section of this manual. These settings are applied as defaults to the configurations found in /etc/virt-who.d/*.conf.

The settings in the \fBglobal\fR affect the overall operation of the application.
The following are options that can be specified in the \fBglobal\fR section:
.TP
\fBinterval\fR
how often to check connected hypervisors for changes (seconds). Also affects how often a mapping is reported.
.TP
\fBreporter_id\fR
The id of this virt-who instance, reported with all mappings.
Defaults to HOSTNAME-MACHINEID
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Enable debugging output
.TP
\fBoneshot\fR
Send the list of guest IDs and exit immediately
.TP
\fBlog_per_config\fR

.TP
\fBlog_dir\fR

.TP
\fBlog_file\fR
The file name to write logs to (used only if log_per_config=False)
.TP
\fBconfigs\fR
A list of files containing configurations for virt-who
Used to specify locations other than default

The settings in the \fBsystem_environment\fR are written to the system's environment and are available for the duration of the process execution.
Example options that can be specified in the \fBsystem_environment\fR section:
.TP

.SH BACKEND SPECIFIC OPTIONS

.SS ESX BACKEND

.TP
\fBfilter_host_parents\fR
Only hosts which cluster ID is specified in comma-separated list in this option will be reported. Put the name into the double-quotes if it contains special characters (like comma). PowerCLI command to find the domain names in VMware `Get-Cluster “ClusterName” | Select ID`

.TP
\fBsimplified_vim\fR
virt-who by default uses stripped-down version of vimService.wsdl file that contains vSphere SOAP API definition. Set this option to \fBfalse\fR to use server provided wsdl file that will be retrieved automatically.

.SS RHEV-M BACKEND

.TP
\fBserver\fR
The default port number is 8443 (that was used the default in RHEV-M <= 3.0). Newer RHEV-M installations uses port 443 by default. Use correct value for your server in format:

server=<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>

.SS KUBEVIRT BACKEND

Kubevirt backend uses a Kubernetes configuration file where there are cluster connection details and an authentication token. There is no need to provide a hostname nor user credentials.
Before using the kubeconfig file please make sure to login to the cluster so the token is written to the file. To login you need to run:

oc login --username=myuser --password=mypass

.SS FAKE BACKEND

Fake backend reads host/guests associations from the file on disk, for example:

[fake-virt]
.br
type=fake
.br
file=/path/to/json
.br
is_hypervisor=True
.br

.TP
\fBtype\fR
Must be always \fBfake\fR.

.TP
\fBis_hypervisor\fR
If \fbtrue\fR (default), the option determines that the fake data are fetched from multihost environment.

.TP
\fBfile\fR
Absolute path to the JSON file that has the same structure as file returned from \fBvirt-who --print\fR command, for example:
.br
{
    "hypervisors": [
.br
        {
.br
            "uuid": "7e98b6ea-0af1-4afa-b846-919549bb0fe2",
.br
            "guests": [
.br
                {
.br
                    "guestId": "8ae19f08-2605-b476-d42e-4bd5a39f466c",
.br
                    "state": 1
.br
                },
.br
                ...
.br
            ]
.br
        },
.br
        ...
.br
    ]
