.TH VIRT-WHO-CONFIG "5" "October 2015" "virt-who"
.SH NAME
virt-who-config - configuration for virt-who
.SH SYNOPISIS
/etc/virt-who.conf
/etc/virt-who.d/*
.SH DESCRIPTION
Configuration format is ini-like.
The configuration files located at /etc/virt-who.d/ are called virtualization backend configurations.
The configuration located at /etc/virt-who.conf is the main configuration for virt-who.
Below are descriptions of both the required and optional options for both kinds of configs and how they are used.
.SH GENERAL CONFIGURATION
The general configuration file (located at /etc/virt-who.conf), has two special sections \fBglobal\fR and \fBdefaults\fR.
The settings that can be specified in \fBdefaults\fR are any setting listed in the \fBVIRTUALIZATION BACKEND CONFIGURATION\fR section of this manual. These settings are applied as defaults to the configurations found in /etc/virt-who.d/*.

The settings in the \fBglobal\fR affect the overall operation of the application.
The following are options that can be specified in the \fBglobal\fR section:
.TP
\fBinterval\fR
how often to check connected hypervisors for changes (seconds). Also affects how often a mapping is reported.
.TP
\fBreporter_id\fR
The id of this virt-who instance, reported with all mappings.
Defaults to HOSTNAME-MACHINEID
.TP
\fBdebug\fR
Enable debugging output
.TP
\fBoneshot\fR
Send the list of guest IDs and exit immediately
.TP
\fBlog_per_config\fR
Write a seperate log file per configuration in the config directory
.TP
\fBlog_dir\fR
The absolute path of the directory to write logs to.
.TP
\fBlog_file\fR
The file name to write logs to (used only if log_per_config=False)
.TP
\fBconfigs\fR
A list of files containing configurations for virt-who
Used to specify locations other than default


.SH VIRTUALIZATION BACKEND CONFIGURATION
Each section (or group), denoted by an arbitrary name for the configuration (in square brackets), is read in

Only required key is \fBtype\fR that has to have one of the allowed virtualization backend names, see virt-who(8).

.TP
\fBfilter_host_uuids\fR
Only hosts which uuid (or hostname or hwuuid, based on \fBhypervisor_id\fR) is specified in comma-separated list in this option will be reported. Put the value into the double-quotes if it contains special characters (like comma).
.TP

.TP
\fBhypervisor_id\fR
Property that should be used as identification of the hypervisor. Can be one of following: \fBuuid\fR, \fBhostname\fR, \fBhwuuid\fR. Note that some virtualization backends don't have all of them implemented. Default is \fBuuid\fR. Applicable to esx and rhevm only. This property is meant to be set up before initial run of virt-who. Changing it later will result in duplicated entries in the subscription manager.

.SH EXAMPLE
[test-esx]
.br
type=esx
.br
server=1.2.3.4
.br
username=admin
.br
password=password
.br
owner=test
.br
env=staging
.br
rhsm_username=admin
.br
rhsm_password=password

.SH BACKEND SPECIFIC OPTIONS

.SS ESX BACKEND

.TP

.TP
\fBexclude_host_parents\fR

.TP
\fBsimplified_vim\fR
virt-who by default uses stripped-down version of vimService.wsdl file that contains vSphere SOAP API definition. Set this option to \fBfalse\fR to use server provided wsdl file that will be retrieved automatically.

.SS RHEV-M BACKEND

.TP
\fBserver\fR
The default port number is 8443 (that was used the default in RHEV-M <= 3.0). Newer RHEV-M installations uses port 443 by default. Use correct value for your server in format:

server=<HOSTNAME_OR_IP_ADDRESS>:<PORT_NUMBER>

.SS FAKE BACKEND

Fake backend reads host/guests associations from the file on disk, for example:

[fake-virt]
.br
type=fake
.br
file=/path/to/json
.br
is_hypervisor=True
.br

.TP
\fBtype\fR
Must be always \fBfake\fR.

.TP
\fBis_hypervisor\fR
If \fbtrue\fR (default), the option determines that the fake data are fetched from multihost environment.

.TP
\fBfile\fR
Absolute path to the JSON file that has the same structure as file returned from \fBvirt-who --print\fR command, for example:
.br
{
    "hypervisors": [
.br
        {
.br
            "uuid": "7e98b6ea-0af1-4afa-b846-919549bb0fe2",

.br
                {
